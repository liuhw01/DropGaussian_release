## :eyes: Overview 
We propose a simple yet powerful regularization technique, **DropGaussian**, for neural rendering with sparse input views.

By randomly eliminating Gaussians during the training process, DropGaussian gives the opportunity for the remaining Gaussians to be more visible with larger gradients, which make them to meaningfully contribute to the optimization process of 3DGS.
This is fairly desirable to alleviate the overfitting problem occurring in sparse-view conditions.

We provide:

- üöÄ **Minimal plug-and-play code snippet** for quick integration
- ‚úÖ **Full implementation** of DropGaussian

## üöÄ Quick Snippet

Here's a minimal example of how to use `DropGaussian` in your training loop:

```python
import torch
# (Assume the rest of the 3DGS pipeline is already set up)
# Create initial compensation factor (1 for each Gaussian)
compensation = torch.ones(opacity.shape[0], dtype=torch.float32, device="cuda")

# Apply DropGaussian with compensation
drop_rate = 0.1
d = torch.nn.Dropout(p=drop_rate)
compensation = d(compensation)

# Apply to opacity
opacity = opacity * compensation[:, None]
```
## ‚úÖ Full implementation
### üì¶ Installation
We provide an installation using Conda package and environment management:
```
git clone https://github.com/DCVL-3D/DropGaussian_release
cd DropGaussian_release
conda env create --file environment.yaml
conda activate DropGaussian
```

**Note:** This Conda environment assumes that **CUDA 12.1** is already installed on your system.

### üóÇÔ∏è Data Preparation

In the data preparation stage, we first reconstruct sparse-view inputs using **Structure-from-Motion (SfM)** with the provided camera poses from the datasets. Then, we perform dense stereo matching using COLMAP‚Äôs `patch_match_stereo` function, followed by `stereo_fusion` to generate the dense stereo point cloud.

### üß™ Training

#### üîπ LLFF Dataset

To train on a single LLFF scene, use the following command:

```
python train.py -s ${DATASET_PATH} -m ${OUTPUT_PATH} --eval -r 8 --n_views {3 or 6 or 9}
```
To train and evaluate on **all LLFF scenes**, simply run the script below:
```
bash scripts/train_llff.sh
```
#### üîπ MipNeRF-360 Dataset

To train on a single MipNeRF-360 scene, use the following command:

```
python train.py -s ${DATASET_PATH} -m ${OUTPUT_PATH} --eval -r 8 --n_views {12 or 24}
```
To train and evaluate on **all MipNeRF-360 scenes**, simply run the script below:
```
bash scripts/train_mipnerf360.sh
```

### üé¨ Rendering & Evaluation
You can perform **rendering and evaluation in a single step** using the following command:
#### üîπ LLFF Dataset
```
python render.py -s -m ${MODEL_PATH} --eval -r 8
```
#### üîπ MipNeRF-360 Dataset
```
python render.py -s -m ${MODEL_PATH} --eval -r 8
```
